## Features

This chatbot is designed to assist users with common e-commerce queries by intelligently understanding their requests and retrieving relevant information from a product and order database.

* **Intelligent Chatbot Core:**
    * Powered by Google's **Gemini LLM** (`gemini-2.0-flash`) for natural language understanding, intent recognition, and response generation.
    * **Retrieve-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The LLM is instructed to use "internal tools" (database queries) to fetch specific information.
* **Database Interaction:** Connects to a MongoDB database containing fictitious e-commerce data.
* **Core Chat Functionality:**
    * Sends user messages to the backend.
    * Receives and displays AI responses.
    * Maintains conversation context using session IDs.
* **Supported Queries (Examples):**
    * "What are the top 5 most sold products?"
    * "Show me the status of order ID 12345."
    * "How many Classic T-Shirts are left in stock?"
    * "Tell me about the Super comfy sneakers."
    * Handles general greetings and conversational fallback.
* **Clarifying Questions:** If an intent is detected but essential information (e.g., an `order_id` or `product_name`) is missing, the LLM will ask clarifying questions.
* **Conversation History Panel:** Allows users to view and load previous chat sessions, improving user experience by maintaining continuity.
* **Modern Frontend UI:** Built with React for a dynamic and interactive chat interface.
* **Full-Stack Containerization:** The entire application (MongoDB, FastAPI Backend, React Frontend + Nginx) is packaged into Docker containers.
* **Orchestration with Docker Compose:** Simplifies running the multi-service application with a single command.

## Technologies Used

**Backend:**
* **Python 3.10+**: Programming language.
* **FastAPI**: High-performance web framework for building APIs.
* **Pymongo**: Official Python driver for MongoDB.
* **Google Generative AI SDK**: Integrates with Gemini LLM.
* **`python-dotenv`**: For managing environment variables.
* **`uvicorn`**: ASGI server for running FastAPI.

**Database:**
* **MongoDB**: NoSQL document database.

**Frontend:**
* **React (with Vite)**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Core web technologies.
* **Nginx**: Used to serve the compiled React static files efficiently in the Docker container.

**Deployment/Containerization:**
* **Docker**: For containerizing individual services.
* **Docker Compose**: For defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

## Setup and Running the Application

Follow these steps to get the entire chatbot application running on your local machine using Docker Compose.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **Git:** To clone the repository.
    * [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* **Python 3.10+ & pip:** Required for the initial data loading script.
    * [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* **Node.js & npm:** Required for frontend development environment (installed by `npm create vite`).
    * [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* **Docker Desktop:** Essential for running Docker containers and Docker Compose. Ensure it's running before proceeding.
    * [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the project:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/dudenrb/think41nikhil.git](https://github.com/dudenrb/think41nikhil.git) # Replace with your actual repository URL
cd think41nikhil
````

### 2\. Prepare Backend Data

The chatbot's knowledge base comes from a separate e-commerce dataset.

a. **Download the dataset:**
Navigate to the dataset repository: `https://github.com/recruit41/ecommerce-dataset`
Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP". Extract the contents.

b. **Place CSV files:**
Inside your cloned project, create a `data` folder within the `backend` directory. Copy all the extracted `.csv` files (e.g., `distribution_centers.csv`, `inventory_items.csv`, `orders.csv`, `products.csv`, `users.csv`) into this `backend/data/` folder.

Your project structure should look like this:

```
think41nikhil/
└── backend/
    └── data/
        ├── distribution_centers.csv
        ├── inventory_items.csv
        ├── order_items.csv
        ├── orders.csv
        ├── products.csv
        └── users.csv
```

### 3\. Initialize MongoDB and Load Data (First Time Only)

For the first run, we need to start the MongoDB container and then use a local Python script to load the e-commerce data into it. The data will persist across container restarts due to the Docker volume.

a. **Start only the MongoDB service:**
From the **project root directory** (`think41nikhil`):

```bash
docker-compose up mongodb -d
```

*The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode (in the background).*
Wait for about 10-15 seconds for the MongoDB container to fully initialize. You can monitor its logs with `docker logs mongodb_container`.

b. **Install Python dependencies for the data loading script:**
If you haven't already, install `pymongo` and `pandas` in your local Python environment:

```bash
pip install pymongo pandas
```

c. **Load the data into the Dockerized MongoDB:**
Navigate into the `backend` directory and run the data loading script:

```bash
cd backend
python load_data.py
cd .. # Go back to the project root
```

You should see output indicating successful connection and insertion of documents into your MongoDB database.

### 4\. Configure Environment Variables (Optional)

The backend service requires a Gemini API key. For most environments, this key is provided automatically. However, if you need to set it manually or are deploying elsewhere, create a `.env` file in your **project root directory** (`think41nikhil/.env`) and add your key:

```
# .env for Docker Compose
# Replace YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Google Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY="" # Leave empty for environments where key is injected
```

*You can obtain a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).*

### 5\. Build and Run the Entire Application

Once MongoDB is populated and your `.env` is configured (if necessary), you can start all services.

From the **project root directory** (`think41nikhil`):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will:

  * Build the `backend` and `frontend` Docker images (using their respective `Dockerfile`s). The `--build` flag ensures they are re-built if any code or Dockerfile changes.
  * Create and start the `mongodb`, `backend`, and `frontend` containers.
  * Set up a Docker network (`chatbot_network`) to allow the services to communicate with each other.

Monitor the terminal output for logs from all three services. Look for messages indicating that MongoDB is listening, FastAPI is running on port 8000, and Nginx is serving on port 80 (within the containers).

### 6\. Access the Application

Once all services are running (it might take a minute or two for the backend and frontend React app to fully start):

  * **Frontend Chatbot UI:** Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:5173`
  * **Backend API Documentation (Swagger UI):** You can also access the backend's interactive documentation at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

Test the chatbot by asking questions like:

  * "What are the top 5 most sold products?"
  * "Show me the status of order ID 9018."
  * "How many Classic T-Shirts are left in stock?"
  * "Tell me about the Super comfy sneakers."
  * "Hello\!"

Experiment with the "Show History" button to view and load past conversations.

### 7\. Stop the Application

To stop all running Docker containers and remove their associated networks:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To also remove the Docker volumes (which will delete your MongoDB data, requiring you to repeat Step 3 for data ingestion if you restart):

```bash
docker-compose down --volumes
```

-----

## API Endpoints

The backend exposes the following REST API endpoints:

  * `GET /`: Basic health check. Returns `{"message": "E-commerce Chatbot Backend is running!"}`.
  * `POST /api/chat`: The primary endpoint for chatbot interaction.
      * **Request Body:** `{"user_id": "string", "message": "string", "session_id": "string | null"}`
      * **Response Body:** `{"session_id": "string", "assistant_response": "string", "conversation_history": [ { "role": "string", "content": "string", "timestamp": "datetime" } ]}`
  * `GET /api/conversations/{user_id}`: Retrieves all conversation sessions for a specific user.
  * `GET /api/conversation/{session_id}`: Retrieves a specific conversation session by its ID.

Full interactive API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the backend is running.

-----

## Development Notes

  * **Backend Live Reload:** The `docker-compose.yml` mounts the `./backend` directory into the backend container and runs FastAPI with `--reload`. This allows you to make changes to your Python backend code on your host machine, and the FastAPI server inside the container will automatically restart.
  * **Frontend Development vs. Production Build:** The `frontend/Dockerfile` builds the React application for production and serves it using Nginx. During active frontend development, you would typically run `npm run dev` in your `frontend` directory outside of Docker to leverage Vite's fast hot-reloading. You would then only build and run the Dockerized frontend for testing the final integrated deployment.
